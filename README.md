RaspPi_RC_Transmitter
=====================

a guide with schematics, code, and notes on how to turn your ps3 controller into an RC transmitter using a Raspberry Pi and Nordic 2.4 [GHz] transmitter


## Prerequisites
* [SDL](http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/lesson01/linux/) installed on the Raspberry Pi.
* [QtSixA](http://qtsixa.sourceforge.net/)

## Tests
Tests are provided to ensure that the PS3 controller is connected to the Pi correctly.

## Additional Setup Notes
In case you cannot connect a PS3 controller, you may need [xboxdrv](http://danielj.se/2013/04/26/how-to-get-your-playstation-3-dualshock-3-sixaxis-controller-to-work-on-linux/)
